# Progressive Growth Transformers (PGT) series, designed to explore how linguistic and reasoning capabilities emerge as a function of model depth.

For example a model ('abs-bvv-6') was not trained monolithically. Instead, it was "grown" constructively, one layer at a time, upon a foundation of frozen, non-semantic visual embeddings ('abs-bvv-1'-> 'abs-bvv-2' -> 'abs-bvv-3' -> 'abs-bvv-4' -> 'abs-bvv-5' -> 'abs-bvv-6')

The core idea is to demonstrate an alternative, more modular and resource-efficient paradigm for building LLMs. The PGT series shows that:

Semantic understanding can emerge without trainable embeddings.
Complex reasoning abilities are a direct result of compositional depth.
Models can be built incrementally, much like a living organism grows, rather than being forged all at once.

# BVV241 Tokenizer Benchmarking & Frozen Embedding Sets

A research resource for cross-model Unicode-centric tokenization, *frozen embedding* LMs, and experimentation on the emergence of semantics and modular model fusion.

## About This Repository

This repo provides:

- Scripts, notebooks, and raw files for construction and benchmarking of *Unicode-based tokenizers* with n-gram/Wikipedia statistical enrichment,
- Precomputed, **L2-normalized, frozen embedding matrices** (for direct plug-in as nn.Embedding),
- Tools for building hybrid vocabularies (Unicode + bigram/trigram extensions + SOTA token string intersection),
- Live benchmarking and visualization pipelines (SOTA vs custom models, t-SNE, BLEU/MMLU/ARC),
- **HuggingFace Hub** integration, with all resources ([Bochkov](https://huggingface.co/Bochkov)).

This work enables research on:

- *Semantic emergence* in LMs trained on non-semantic, fixed surface embeddings,
- Unified and modular architectures for multi-expert, multilingual, or scalable models,
- Experimental fusion of models with different tokenizer histories.


## Tokenizer and Embedding Variants

### 1. [bvv241-2-3](https://huggingface.co/Bochkov/bvv241-2-3)
- **Unicode plane** (0–65535): All single Unicode codepoints (monograms).
- **Private/unused Unicode ranges**: Wikipedia bigrams/trigrams.
- **Vocabulary**: 65,536 tokens; **Embedding**: 1024-dim, L2-normalized, frozen (**no semantics**).
- Suitable for: *Baseline Unicode LM research, non-semantic embedding experiments.*

### 2. [bvv241-max](https://huggingface.co/Bochkov/bvv241-max)
- **Unicode monograms** + bigrams/trigrams + *intersection of token strings* across SOTA models (o200k_base, cl100k_base, Mistral-Nemo, DeepSeek-R1, etc).
- **Vocabulary**: 131,072 tokens; **Embedding**: 1024-dim, frozen.
- Suitable for: *Unified tokenizer/embedding research; plug-and-play fusion across SOTA models.*

### 3. [bvv241-nemo](https://huggingface.co/Bochkov/bvv241-nemo)
- Vocabulary of Mistral-Nemo SOTA model with frozen *surface-level* (non-semantic) embeddings.
- **Vocabulary**: 131,072; **Embedding**: 1024-dim, frozen.
- Suitable for: *Direct Mistral-Nemo token/embedding comparison.*

### 4. [bvv241-abs](https://huggingface.co/Bochkov/bvv241-abs)
- As `bvv241-max`, but **embedding size 4096**.
- Suitable for: *Experiments on scaling embedding space.*

**All embedding matrices:** L2-normalized, *fixed/frozen*, contain **no semantic information**.

## Quick Start

from transformers import AutoTokenizer

from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download

import torch

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('Bochkov/bvv241-max')

emb_path = hf_hub_download(repo_id="Bochkov/bvv241-max", filename="normalized_embeddings_weights.pt")

embeddings = torch.load(emb_path)  # shape: [vocab_size, emb_dim]

## ⚗️ Research Scope & Scientific Context
## Purpose:

These resources enable:

Investigation into semantic emergence when training transformers with fixed, non-semantic ("surface-level") embeddings.

Plug-and-play modular/MoE experiments: plug-in new "experts" or fuse LMs trained with different tokenizations, since embeddings are structurally identical and fixed.

Exploration of Unicode-standardized, reproducible vocabularies for multilingual and cross-model pipelines.

Scientific novelty:

These embeddings are never trained, encode no semantic information, and are suitable for research into meaning arising solely in transformer layers above embedding.

You are free to combine, swap, and experiment with models and tokenizers—unified by their Unicode-surface-based, frozen embedding matrix—without retraining! This enables fair benchmarking of the ability of deep architectures (alone) to synthesize meaning.
